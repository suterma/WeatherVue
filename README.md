# WeatherVue
 A simple, Raspberry Pi based weather station, that posts to a Vue.js app via MQTT. 
 
The publish part is based on my other repository [WeatherPress](https://github.com/suterma/WeatherPress), which is described in detail in the corresponding [blog post](https://qrys.ch/a-raspberry-pi-based-weather-station-posting-to-wordpress/).

The subscribe and display part is done entirely in Vue.js, as a learning project.
